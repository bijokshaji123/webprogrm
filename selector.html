A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style<br>
A simple selector is either a type selector or universal selector followed immediately by zero or more attribute selectors, ID selectors, or pseudo-classes, in any order. The simple selector matches if all of its components match.<br>
pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or "active", like this: a:hover { /* your style here */ }<br>
A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element<br>
<p>ID selector uses the ID attribute of an HTML element to select one unique element on a page. To use an ID selector in CSS, you simply write a hashtag (#) followed by the ID of the element</p>
<div class="center">class selector is formatted as a period (.) character followed by the name of the class. It selects all elements with that class attribute so that unique CSS declarations can be applied to those specific elements without affecting other elements on the page.</div>
